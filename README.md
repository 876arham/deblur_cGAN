# deblur_cGAN

OTIS dataset was unclear there was no true image ,only blurred ones were there , so i had to use gopro-light dataset which is of 9 gb.
I got the file structure of go pro dataset online but was not able to download it, and also some of the preprocessing and data loading code is copied from an online source.
